<p>You know, it&#39;s funny. It&#39;s been 3 years, and up until now, it&#39;s been the same experience the entire time. But y&#39;know what? That&#39;s okay, we&#39;ll get there. One day. ðŸ’™</p>
<p>Chances are, if you stumbled on this site, you found me on my Discord. If so, then hi! Thanks for giving my site a look at. It&#39;s not much now, but I&#39;d like to hope rectify that in the soon upcoming future. Hopefully, sooner than 3 years. Hey, it only took 3 years to add an actual useful description to this site!</p>
<p>My name is Bat horse, and I like mangos.

<p>That&#39;s an updated picture of me. I love Synthwave! Thanks <a href="https://derpibooru.org/tags/artist-colon-notetaker">Notetaker37</a> for drawing it &lt;3
I&#39;m also quite fond of aviation, and programming! I&#39;m doing my best to make the world a better place, even if it is in small steps. I live to make people happy, and maybe one of these days, I&#39;ll succeed in making something people enjoy.</p>
<p>If you see me around, feel free to say hi! I don&#39;t bite, don&#39;t let the fangs scare you.
If you&#39;re one of those web crawler bots that scans for social media links, fuck off. I&#39;m not linking my socials here. </p>
<p>If you need to contact me, there&#39;s a good chance you can find me on a platform :)</p>
<p>Also, thanks for being patient with me. I hope to have something more formal than this later on.</p>
